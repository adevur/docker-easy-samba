### (2019-05-31 UTC) roadmap update
New improvements are coming to `easy-samba` (probably in future version `1.5.0`):

- At the moment (`easy-samba` version `1.3.x`), one can create only one anonymous shared folder (setting `guest` property of `config.json` to the path of the anonymous shared folder). In the future, it will be possible to create multiple anonymous shared folders, using `shares` section of `config.json`: for example, `"shares": [{ "name": "folder1", "path": "/share/folder1", "access": ["rw:*"] }, { "name": "folder2", "path": "/share/folder2", "guest": "rw" }]` will create two shared folders: `folder1` is a regular shared folder (which every user can write and read), and `folder2` is an anonymous shared folder (that can be read and written without login).

- In `groups` section of `config.json`, `users` property will be renamed to `members`. Also in `ConfigGen.js` library, `config.groups.addUser()` and the other methods will be renamed to `config.groups.addMember()` etc. For example, `"groups": [{ "name": "group1", "users": ["user1", "user2"] }]` will become `"groups": [{ "name": "group1", "members": ["user1", "user2"] }]`.

### (2019-05-30 UTC) roadmap update
Today, `easy-samba` version `1.3.0` has been released, with two new important features: `config.gen.js` and `ConfigGen.js`. Documentation of these new features is almost complete.

In the next days, new improvements will be made to `ConfigGen.js` API, as well as other improvements to `easy-samba` itself:

- `guest` section of `config.json` will become optional. If a `guest` section is not present in `config.json`, `easy-samba` will assume that its value is `false`.

- Work is in progress about making `easy-samba` more responsive to configuration changes: at the moment (`easy-samba` version `1.3.x`), after you change some parameters in your `config.json` file, you need to stop the `easy-samba` container, and then start it again, in order to update `easy-samba`'s running configuration. This can take several seconds, and all the clients connected to your SAMBA server will probably get disconnected quickly. In the future, you will be able to edit the `config.json` file in your `easy-samba` container, and `easy-samba` will automatically update its configuration based on the new file (hoping that this will not disconnect your current clients).

- You'll also have the option to edit the `config.json` file through an always-running `config.gen.js` script: at the moment, `config.gen.js` script must terminate after it generated the new `config.json` file. In the future, your `config.gen.js` script will have also the possibility to never terminate, and constantly update the `config.json` file; and `easy-samba` will then constantly update its running configuration automatically.

### (2019-05-30 UTC) easy-samba 1.3.0 released (with new features)
Stable version 1.3.0 of `easy-samba` has been released.

This version brings new features to `easy-samba`.

Click [here](https://github.com/adevur/docker-easy-samba/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG.md#stable-feature-130-2019-05-30-utc) for changelog.

### (2019-05-29 UTC) upcoming feature `ConfigGen`
An upcoming feature will be soon implemented (not sure in which future version of `easy-samba`), called `ConfigGen`.

`ConfigGen` is a simple stand-alone Javascript library, capable of generating a `config.json` configuration file dynamically, using Javascript as the scripting language. This will help automatizing and scripting repetitive operations in the writing of a `config.json` file.

More info will be released in the next days.

### (2019-05-29 UTC) roadmap for easy-samba 1.3
A list of planned features that are coming to `easy-samba` version 1.3:

- In the `groups` section of `config.json`, at the moment one can only specify usernames to be included in a group (e.g. `"groups": [{ "name": "group1", "users": ["user1", "user2", "user3"] }]`). In version 1.3 of `easy-samba`, it will be possible to also specify groups to be included in the group (e.g. `{ "name": "group2", "users": ["group1", "user4"] }` means that `group2` contains all the users in `group1` plus `user4`).

### (2019-05-16 UTC) easy-samba 1.2.0 released (with new features)
Stable version 1.2.0 of `easy-samba` has been released.

This version brings new features to `easy-samba`.

Click [here](https://github.com/adevur/docker-easy-samba/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG.md#stable-feature-120-2019-05-16-utc) for changelog.

### (2019-05-12 UTC) roadmap for next versions of easy-samba
A list of improvements that are coming to `easy-samba` 1.2:

- It will be possible to restart a stopped container. At the moment (`easy-samba` 1.1.x), if you stop an `easy-samba`
container, you cannot start it again, but you have to remove it and you have to run a new `easy-samba` container.

- It will be possible to customize `[global]` section of `/etc/samba/smb.conf`, from within `easy-samba`'s `config.json`.

Planned improvements for `easy-samba` 2.0:

- Testing is in progress for using RHEL 8.0 as the container's OS. This is needed in order to prepare to migrate from CentOS 7 to CentOS 8, when the latter will be released. SAMBA version available in CentOS 7.6 is `4.8.3`, while in RHEL 8.0 is `4.9.1`. Migration from CentOS 7 to CentOS 8 is expected for `easy-samba` version 2.0.

- When `easy-samba` version 2.0 will be released, `easy-samba` 1.x.x will become the new long-term version.

- Since `easy-samba` version 1.x.x is going to be a long-term branch, some code cleanup has to be finished before the release of version 2.0. Also, documentation has to be finished, because there are still some missing chapters.

### (2019-04-27 UTC) easy-samba 1.1.0 released (with new features)
Stable version 1.1.0 of `easy-samba` has been released.

This version brings new features to `easy-samba`.

Click [here](https://github.com/adevur/docker-easy-samba/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG.md#stable-feature-110-2019-04-27-utc) for changelog.

### (2019-04-24 UTC) preview of easy-samba 1.1
Stable version 1.1.0 of `easy-samba` will soon be released.
This version will bring a couple of new features to `access` property of shared folders:

- Wildcard `*`: you will be able to use `*` to specify that an access rule applies to all users.
For example: `["ro:*", "rw:user1"]` means that all users have read-only permissions on the shared folder,
except for `user1`, which also has write permissions.

- New permission `no:`: you will be able to specify a new type of permission on users and groups, i.e. `no:` permission.
When you place it before a username, a group name or wildcard `*`, it just means that the subject has no access at all to
the shared folder. For example: `["rw:group1", "ro:user1", "no:user2"]` means that all members of group `group1` have read
and write permissions on the shared folder, except for `user1`, which has read-only permissions, and for `user2`, which has no access at all.
